# ME100-Moodlighting-project
This is a mood lighting project for UC Berkeley ME100 class. Code and project designed and written by Michael Jia and Xavier Barneclo.

The design of the project: Created a moodlighting device targeted for teens and students who want a notification system for weather as well as an ambient lighting as decoration for their room.

The casing is SLA printed with an initial prototype made from PLA. The lights are routed behind the casing and attached to 2 microcontrollers: an ESP32 and a Raspberry Pi 3b. There is also a microphone board that is used for voice recognition for the moodlighting control instead of buttons.
