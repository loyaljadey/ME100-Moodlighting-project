the rain drop calculations

we need to calculate the time intervals for the same difference travelled for the light.
the governing equation is d = 0.5 * g * t^2

we can use an the equations to generate a series of times and find the time intervals from that array.
we can set the time interval to the sleep time that between switching the light on and off

the distance between the lights are 13mm

d = [0.013, 0.026, .....]

divisor = 0.5*g
t = [x/divisor for x in d]
